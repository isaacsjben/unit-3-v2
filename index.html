            <h4>About this map:</h4>
            <p>The legacy of the Soviet Union may have faded to oblivion for many Westerners, but in Russia, this legacy has drastically shaped the human geography of the land, and is visible in the distribution of peoples today. From the 1930s to the 1950s, Stalin's government forcefully relocated entire nations of people from their homelands to remote and isolated parts of the USSR. The reasons for these forced resettlements were numerous, and included the need to fill ethnically-cleansed and conquered territories, to subdue "enemies of the state" (ie. Germans during WWII), and to exploit human labor in remote parts of the country. Dozens of nationalities were affected, including the Russians themselves. Russian peasants who owned land, called 'Kulaks', were forced off their property by the government and sent to work elsewhere too.

            Though many nationalities were affected, this map looks at five ethnic groups in modern Russia: Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Armenians, and Germans of the Volga River. The dominance of ethnic Russians across most parts of the country is easy to see, though it should be noted that their homeland only consists of the westernmost-fifth of the country. Ukrainians, whose homeland lies just beyond Russia's western border, are found all over Russia, with high populations in some of the most remote parts of Siberia. The Tatars are concentrated in their homeland, Tatarstan, though significant populations are spread throughout the country. Similar phenomena can be observed for the Armenians and Germans. This map illustrates the widespread distribution of these peoples that has resulted from the Soviet resettlement policies, which explains questions such as, "Why are there so many Ukrainians living in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, thousands of miles from their homelands in Eastern Europe?"
